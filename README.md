# btb-challenge
Solution for BTB Security coding challenge.

For this challenge I decided to use Javascript, 
as I am most familiar with the `fetch` API and have been practicing with using it lately for other projects, mostly learning React JS. 
The site is hosted on GitHub Pages so that it can be seen and used right from the browser, and it is optional to download the logs, 
but a button is provided to do so once they have loaded.

I am using D3.js for the Bar Graph visualization since I have used it before during my time as a research assistant at Rutgers.

Finally, I used a bit of SCSS to make the page look a bit nicer.

Please let me know what you think, and thank you for taking the time to look at the solution!
